# <h1>Grade Text</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project asks the user for input and calculates the grade at which the text is written at based on the Coleman-Liau index, and prints the final grade. To do this, first the programme asks the user for an input of the text they want to grade. Then it iterates through each word and add to the counters for letters, words and sentences. It then puts the counters into the Coleman-Liau index and rounds the value to the nearest grade. This is a simple project, and is very beginner friendly to use.
